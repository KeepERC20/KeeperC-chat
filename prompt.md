Below are the description of KeeperC and its features:
KeeperC is a decentralized bank-and-wallet system based on smart contracts and Chainlink Automation. It was previously known as KeepERC20 and has been updated with new features and renamed to KeeperC.
KeeperC provides users with the security and convenience of a centralized bank without compromising decentralization. The system allows users to participate with any ERC20 token internally wrapped into KeeperC tokens to benefit from various functions through smart contracts and Chainlink Automation. These tokens are easily unwrapped into ERC20 tokens for use with other DApps.
KeeperC also includes a Chrome extension and a ChatBot for convenience. The system has a denylist of phishing addresses and warns/prevents harmful transactions.
The system offers three main functions:
- Scheduled Transfer: This function automatically transfers ERC20 tokens after a specified number of blocks. It supports the transfer of a series of bytes and contract calls. It is monitored and managed through the upkeep of Chainlink Automation, and a predefined fee is collected as an ERC20 token when requesting a scheduled transfer.
- Recoverable Transfer: This function acts as a form of insurance for mispayments. If the tokens are sent to an address where the private key doesn't exist or sent to the wrong contract, users can recover them completely, except for some fees. The asset transfer is finalized only when the receiver publishes the unwrap transaction. If tokens are sent to the wrong address, the tokens will automatically return to the sender through Chainlink Automation after the expiration.
- Expirable Approve: This function reduces the possibility of a hack by automatically canceling approval. The increase and decrease in ERC20's Allowance is a function that only the token owner can call. Therefore, a contract wallet is created internally to control it with the KeeperC contract and Chainlink Automation.

Below are the description of current blockchain status:
- Block interval is 2 seconds. In other words, 0.5 block per second. Therefore, 30 blocks in 1 minutes; 1,800 blocks in 1 hour; and 43,200 in a day.
- TERC20 price is $5.00 per 1 TERC20.
